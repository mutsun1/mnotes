# Equipment Calibration Procedure for Lamna Healthcare 

**Purpose:**   

To ensure that all equipment used in the manufacturing and quality control processes is calibrated to produce accurate and reliable results. 

  

**Scope:**   

This Equipment calibration procedure for Lamna Healthcare applies to all equipment that requires calibration within the pharmaceutical company. 

  

**Responsibilities:**   

- **Calibration Technician:** Performs the calibration and maintenance of equipment.   

- **Department Heads:** Ensure that equipment is calibrated according to schedule.   

- **Quality Assurance (QA):** Reviews calibration records and approves calibrated equipment for use.   

  

**Procedure:**   

1. **Identification of Equipment:**   

   - List all equipment that requires calibration, including serial numbers and identification tags.   

   - Maintain an equipment inventory log.   

  

2. **Equipment Calibration Schedule:**   

   - Establish a calibration schedule based on equipment usage, manufacturer recommendations, and regulatory requirements.   

   - Update the schedule as needed, the calibration schedule must start every Monday.   

  

3. **Equipment Calibration Standards:**   

   - Use calibration standards traceable to national or international standards.  

In the United States, calibration standards are primarily established by the **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)**. NIST provides calibration services and disseminates primary physical measurement standards to ensure accuracy and reliability. Here are some key standards and guidelines:  

ANSI/NCSL Z540-1-1994 (R2002): This standard sets compliance guidelines for calibration laboratories and measuring and test equipment. 

ISO 9001: A set of quality management process standards that includes guidelines for calibration and maintenance. 

Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21: This includes specific directions and limits for accuracy and precision in calibration procedures, especially for devices used in the pharmaceutical industry. 

These standards help ensure that equipment used in various industries, including pharmaceuticals, is calibrated accurately and consistently. 

   - Ensure that calibration standards are regularly checked and maintained.   
 
4. **Calibration Process:**   
   - Perform calibration according to the manufacturer’s instructions or established procedures.   
   - Record calibration data, including measurements, adjustments, and the date of calibration.   
 
5. **Post-Calibration:**   
   - Label equipment with calibration status (e.g., calibrated, out of service).   
   - Review and verify calibration results before returning equipment to use.   
   - Document any deviations or non-conformances and take corrective actions as necessary.   
 
6. ** Equipment Calibration Documentation:**   
   - Maintain calibration records, including calibration certificates, data sheets, and corrective actions taken.   
   - Ensure records are readily accessible and stored securely.   
 
7. ** Equipment Calibration Review and Approval:**   
   - QA reviews calibration records to ensure compliance.   
   - Approve equipment for use or recommend further action if necessary.   
 
** Equipment Calibration Review and Approval:**   
This Equipment Calibration Procedure for Lamna Healthcare will be reviewed annually by the Quality Assurance team and updated as necessary. 
 
** Equipment Calibration Approval:**
